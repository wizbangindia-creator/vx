// FAQ - Updated content
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Can I transfer from a private university to a public university in Berlin?",
    answer: "Yes, it is possible, and many students explore this option during their studies in Germany.\n\nHowever, it's important to understand that this is not a direct transfer. In most cases, you apply again to a public university, and your previous studies are evaluated for credit recognition.\n\nSome students choose to switch for financial reasons, while others prefer to stay in private universities due to their structured support, smaller classes, and flexibility.\n\nThe right choice depends on your individual priorities — and both pathways are valid.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save by switching to a public university?",
    answer: "Public universities in Germany are generally more affordable, as they charge only administrative fees (around €300–€600 per semester), while private universities have tuition fees that can range from €10,000 to €20,000 per year.\n\nAt the same time, private universities often provide added value through smaller class sizes, industry-focused programs, and more personalized academic support.\n\nFor students considering switching, the financial savings can be significant — but it's always important to balance cost with the overall learning experience and career goals.\n\nWe also help students explore cost-efficient options across both pathways, including competitive service pricing and access to university-level discounts where available.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will all my credits be transferred?",
    answer: "Credit transfer depends on how closely your previous subjects match the new course.\n\nIn many cases, students are able to transfer some of their credits, but not always all. Public universities tend to follow stricter academic matching, while private universities may offer more flexibility in recognizing prior learning.\n\nBecause of this, some students continue from a later semester, while others may need to step back slightly.\n\nA well-planned approach can help maximize your credit recognition.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the transfer process take?",
    answer: "The timeline depends on the intake and the university, but generally, the process takes a few weeks to a couple of months.\n\nPublic universities follow fixed deadlines and structured timelines, while private universities often offer more flexible admission cycles and faster processing.\n\nThis is why some students choose to stay in private universities for continuity, while others plan ahead to switch at the right time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my student visa be affected during the transfer?",
    answer: "Changing universities is allowed in Germany, and your visa is generally not affected as long as your student status remains valid.\n\nYou will need to update your details with the authorities once you switch universities.\n\nWhether you stay in a private university or move to a public one, the key is to ensure there are no gaps in your enrollment.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I want to change my course/major completely?",
    answer: "This is possible in both private and public universities.\n\nPrivate universities often offer more flexibility when it comes to changing programs, while public universities may require stricter subject alignment and eligibility criteria.\n\nIf the new course is very different, you may need to start from an earlier semester.\n\nMany students use this opportunity to realign their studies with their long-term goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee admission?",
    answer: "No consultancy can guarantee admission, as universities make the final decision.\n\nWhat we do is guide you based on your profile, helping you choose the most suitable options — whether that's continuing in a private university or switching to a public one.\n\nOur focus is on helping you make a decision that is academically right, financially sensible, and practical in the long term.",
